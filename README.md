# Face-and-Eye-Detection
We all know video is a collection of frames. So, we take a frame from video and then process it and implement our code on it. and show it on screen.
import XML file of out training data.
First step is to convert a frame in gray scale to pre-processing because in grey scale it reduce dimensions and reduce complexity.
Then first we work on face, so, we train our model and make a rectangle on our face .
Then we know eyes lies in our face rectangle, so, we apply another rectangle in our face rectangle on our eyes.
then show this frame on the screen.
We put this in while loop because we continue take the frames and when the frames are not coming it will automatically get's out of the loop.
